        <h1>My Experience with Minecraft</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>The Beginning!!!</h2>
        <p>
            I started playing minecraft when I got an Xbox 360 for Christmas one year. I have so many memories of
            playing the
            Xbox 360 version with my brother. We would usually play on a superflat world. My brother would work on a
            theme park and I would create whatever I wanted. We essentially split the world in two because of the
            limited world sizes on Legacy Console Version. We created so much stuff on that Xbox and I am so glad that
            we still have the same Xbox 360, although it is in storage.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Dark Age...</h2>
        <p>
            Eventually, the Xbox 360 version stopped reciving updates. The last update that Xbox 360 recieved was
            Updtate Aquatic. With a lack of updates and us just growing up we both stopped playing Minecraft. Time
            passes and eventually through the power of YouTube, I decide to buy Minecraft (Java Edition) for my laptop.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Renaissance?</h2>
        <p>
            Once I bought Minecraft (Java Edition) it was the same magic all those years ago. The only diffecrence was
            that my brother was unable to play. This time instead of playing in creative mode I played in survival mode,
            something I never did before. Whenever me and my brother would play we would play on creative mode
            exculsively. Anyways, I played a ton but never really stuck with a world. I even tried out some survival
            mode challenges, such as Superflat Survival. But something never felt quite right imo.

        <h2>The Return to Multiplayer!</h2>
        <p>
            I am now in college and although I don't have much time to play Minecraft, I love doing it. I especially
            love playing Minecraft with boyfriend! We do it from time to time and we honestly lose track of time because
            we're having so much fun. We play on Java survival world with a vanilla install. Here are some <a
