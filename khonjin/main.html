            <h3>What is Khonjin House?</h3>
            <p>Khonjin House is a web series created by Connor Lavery, better known online as Khonjin. Khonjin House started in 2015 and ended in 2016, ended again in 2019, and finally ended in 2021 The series consists of short comedy videos that are seemingly unrelated. The Khonjin House universe is absolute nonsense and <i>anything</i> can happen.</p>
            <h3>My Experience</h3>
            <p>iirc I discovered the series in 2016 when it originally ended. The Khonjin House movie was in my YouTube recommended and I decided to watch it because I liked the thumbnail. Little did I know, I stumbled upon the funniest web series ever. After I found out about the series, four more seasons came out in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021 respectfully.</p>
