                <p>
                    this is really hard to write about honestly but im doing it. i have had thoughts of being autistic
                    for a couple years now. there are just been a couple things that have put me off the idea. one of
                    the major things is that i was diagnosised with ADHD instead of autism. i have gone through the
                    autism diagnosis but idk something has never felt right. i dont want to get into specifics but my
                    childhood wasnt the greatest. anyways conculsion: i might be autistic.

                <p>
                    i have waited 10 years for a game in the little known series called pikmin. pikmin is a incredibly
                    unique series where you command little plant guys. pikmin 4 comes out july 21st and pikmin 3
                    originally came out in 2013. i was 8 years old when pikmin 3 came out. now, pikmin fans (like me)
                    werent left 10 years without any pikmin games, just no mainline ones. we got a mobile game and a mid
                    2d platformer spinoff.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    the demo for pikmin 4 came out in mid june and it was packed with content. i know that the full game
                    will be great because every pikmin game thus far has been great. there was so much stuff i didnt
                    discover in the demo that im excited to explore the first area again. aaaaa im so excited!!!

                <p>
                    dreams are weird aren't they? well last night i had a dream that i wished was real so bad. i had a
                    girlfriend something ive never genuinely had before. she was a butch trans girl with light brown
                    wavy hair, and brown eyes. she was super nice and very in tune with her emotions. she took me for a
                    romantic walk at a park. the worst thing is i dont remember her name. i know she had one but i
                    cannot for the life of me remember it. i know what im about to say sounds delusional but i really
                    miss her. if only that dream was real and she was my girlfriend.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    anyways, i also had another weird dream a couple nights ago. this dream was about an online friend.
                    i was communicating to this friend through the dream. i was having an irl conversation with this
                    person which has never happened. although it wasnt a normal conversation as it felt as if we were
                    communicating telepathically. i no longer have a way of contacting this person to my knowledge. both
                    were strange although i dont know which i would say was starnger.
