        Ninjago is LEGO's longest runnning orginal theme and is my favorite LEGO
        theme. This is thanks in part to the show that goes hand in hand with
        the sets. The show is probably my favorite show as of now. I like a lot
        of the seasons from the show and have plenty of Ninjago sets. The show
        is techniaclly two shows as the show had a soft reboot after season 15.
        Ninjago: Masters of Spinjiztu/LEGO Ninjago and Ninjago Dragons Rising.
