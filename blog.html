        <p>
          i have been super busy with college so i havent been able to update my website at all.
          im hoping to overhaul the design of the site soon because i dont like how the main pages look.
          hopefully now that i can allow myself some time to work on the site updates might be more frequent.

        <h1>1st Semester of College</h1>
        <h2>Posted 09/07/23</h2>
        <p>
          I started my 1st semester of college roughly 3 weeks ago. The first week and a half was stressful,
          but now I have gotten into the groove of things, and it is much easier. The only thing that worries
          me is the math class I'm starting next week, as I don't know the course. Anyways that's my life
          update for now!
